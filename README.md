Rotation Game

Company Description:
Game of Songs is an idea born of many long road trips, hours spent sitting around with friends, and a love for music. The premise is simple. Hook up your iPhone to any speaker, auxiliary cord, or music playing device and open your music streaming service of choice. The Game of Songs is a card game, a twist on the popular game Cards Against Humanity. To play the Game of Songs you simply draw a card from the 120 card deck and choose a song based on the category selected.  You can play it in groups by passing the auxiliary cord around. You can play it by yourself to test your music skills. 

Card Examples:






Over the years I have developed probably 300 card ideas through trial and error. Whenever Iâ€™m on a road trip or hanging out with friends I pull out the list of card ideas and use it to guide the music for the night. The gameplay is simple, yet incredibly fun. I have always wanted to create a physical copy of the Game of Songs, but never fleshed out the idea. 

I decided on a $19.99 price point to sell the game for two reasons. First of all, I wanted to undercut the prices of the more popular card games (Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity). Second of all, I wanted to create a profit of at least 2.5 times the cost of production and shipping. Based on my decently thorough internet research, I feel that 2.5 times production+shipping is a good target. 




How I am Funding the Project:
I wanted to create a business that I could personally fund, which meant keeping my initial investment under $40,000. This way I would not have to take out loans or ask friends/family for capital. 

Results of Calculating Net Present Value:

The NPV of my company idea is overwhelmingly negative at -$17,892.92. The reasons for this are numerous. First of all, having to pay myself a salary, along with Luke Ellis (my roommate and employee) left me at a huge disadvantage due to the small scale of this project. Another problem I ran into was inventory costs. I had to re-order at least 500 products per year to keep my gross revenue at 2.5x product cost/shipping. However, I cannot in good conscious project sales reaching 500 products until the third year, leaving me with an incredible amount of left over inventory per year. Lastly, and most importantly, I do not think I priced my product high enough. I could charge around $45 dollars per product to break even, but that is just an unrealistic number to expect consumers to purchase at. Even charging $30 per product would leave my NPV at around -$4,500.

Conclusion: 
Game of Songs is not a viable business venture. While something dear to my heart, it just is not a scalable business when factoring in paying myself a salary and the price point of $19.99 being unfeasible. It is most definitely not a good sign when my exit strategy is selling my business for                  -$47,487.03 dollars at the end of 5 years!
